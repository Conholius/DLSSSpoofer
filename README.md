# DLSSSpoofer

Spoofs your GPU Architecture to make it look like your GPU is DLSS compatible, allowing the use of CyberFSR2 in games that use DLSS (3?).

Instructions on how to use when I feel like it, but it's simple as compiling, renaming to version.dll and dropping the DLL in the game folder where the .exe is at.
